                    Narendra Damodardas Modi born 17 September 1950 is 
                    an Indian politician who has served as the 14th Prime Minister of India since May 2014. Modi was the 
                    Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is 
                    a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing 
                    Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister from 
                    outside the Indian National Congress.

                    Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. 
                    He was introduced to the RSS at age eight. His account of helping his father sell tea at the Vadnagar
                     railway station has not been reliably corroborated. At age 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, 
                     whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later when legally 
                     required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned 
                     him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, 
                     rising to the rank of general secretary.

                    <p>Modi's first year as PM saw significant centralisation of power. Modi, who initially 
                        lacked a majority in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Indian Parliament, passed a
                         number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of 
                         power. His administration enacted a bill to increase its control over the appointment 
                         of judges and reducing that of the judiciary. In December 2014, he abolished the 
                         Planning Commission, replacing it with the National Institution for Transforming India 
                         (NITI Aayog), concentrating the power previously with the planning commission 
                         in the person of the PM. The Planning Commission had in previous 
                         years been criticised for creating inefficiency in the government and of not fulfilling 
                         its role of improving social welfare but since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, 
                         it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.
                         <br>
                         Since May 2023, ethnic tensions between some groups have resulted in violent 
                         clashes in Manipur. After 1 month of the violence, nearly 100 were killed and 
                         more than 36,000 people were displaced. Narendra Modi has been criticized 
                         for his lack of reaction towards the violence.
